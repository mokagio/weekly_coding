weekly_coding
=============

Collection of weekly experiments and coding researches. The goal of a *daily_coding* repo is too much for me, so I'll try to stick to at least one per week. This repo is nothing more than a playground oriented to learning new techniques, languages, etc...

**Inline comments, PRs, and suggestions are very welcome!**
