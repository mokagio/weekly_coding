#UIDatePicker

I don't know why or where I got the impression that UIDatePickers where somehow hard to use... They're increadibly simple. Part of the simplicity is due to the fact that they're quite rigid components, for example you can't change their `frame`.

In this coding excercise -_incomplete at the moment, and problably will never be_- I'll try to setup a `UIDatePicker` and mess around with it's options.

Official Apple doc can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIDatePicker_Class/Reference/UIDatePicker.html).

###TODOs

* Disable UI interaction while the picker is spinning, in order to avoid submitting incomplete data.
* Implemente a `UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer`.
